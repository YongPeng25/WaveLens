  abstract = {Robust velocity model building from limited-offset datasets remains a challenging task. Joint full-waveform inversion (JFWI) uses both early arrivals and reflections to reconstruct shallow and deep macro-velocities. The recently developed localized adaptive waveform inversion provides an effective way to capture phase mismatch between observed and predicted data via a local matching filter. We propose using the phase mismatch estimated by the same local matching filter to define a robust misfit function in JFWI. Preliminary numerical examples confirm that integrating JFWI and LAWI can significantly improve the velocity macro-model building.}
