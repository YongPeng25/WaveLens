## Introduction 
* Fork [this repository](https://github.com/sbryngelson/sbryngelson.github.io) by clicking the `fork` button in the top-right corner of its Github page.
* Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)  (version less than 4.0 required) on your local computer
    * On MacOS, you will need to upgrade your Ruby version from the depricated v2.3 that is shipped. Follow the above Jekyll instructions closely.
* Run `$ bundle exec jekyll serve` in the repository root directory
* Your site is now hosted locally at `localhost:4000/WaveLens`, which you can access with your web browser.
   * It will be automatically rebuilt as you save changes to the files it contains.
   Refreshing your web browser reveals these changes.
   
* Run `$ bundle exec jekyll build` in the repository root directory 
* Run `$ rake publish` in the repository root directory then you can find the updated website online
